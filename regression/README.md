# Regression Algorithms

This folder provides a collection of regression models that can be utilized for predictive analysis across different fields, including finance, healthcare, and more.

## Included Algorithms

Linear Regression: 
- Simple and multiple linear regression models suitable for straightforward predictive tasks.

Polynomial Regression:
- Extends linear models to capture non-linear relationships.

Ridge Regression: 
- Incorporates L2 regularization to handle multicollinearity and improve model robustness.

Lasso Regression: 
- Uses L1 regularization for feature selection and model sparsity.

## Applications

These regression models can be applied to various domains:
- Finance: Predict stock prices, financial metrics.
- Healthcare: Estimate patient outcomes, disease progression.
- Marketing: Forecast sales, analyze customer behavior.
